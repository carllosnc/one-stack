## What's in the box?

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS
- Drizzle ORM
- Auth.js
- Bun

## First steps

Before you start, you need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```

This will start the database in development mode. To more details about turso, you can check the [turso documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/introduction).


**Database generation and migration**

To generate the database schema and run the migration, you need to run the following commands:

Generation
```bash
bun run db:generate
```

Migration
```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

Drizzle studio
```bash
bun run db:studio
```

The commands above are abstraction of drizzle-kit commands, you can check the [drizzle-kit documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/kit-overview) for more details.
